# degree-progress-tracker v1.1.1

This is a python program designed to assist in tracking university degree progress.
It should be compatible with most UK degree structures.
It assumes that your degree is divided into modules which are comprised of coursework and exams.

The program allows you to create modules and then pieces of work within those modules.
The program calculates statistics of your course progress and displays them.

ROADMAP:

- v1.1.1 - Introduced macOS compatibility, with small changes in code to accommodate this. Added new displayed message when attempting to change the target grade to the existing target grade (e.g. 2:1 to 2:1).
- v1.1.x - Bug fixes from v1.1.1.
- v1.2.0 - New features such as ability to save/load profiles and create special modules consisting of only one exam.  
- v1.3.0 - Lots of ambitious features added (possibly including graphing of results and much more detailed statistics).
