# degree-progress-tracker v1.0.2

This is a python program designed to assist in tracking university degree progress.
It should be compatible with most UK degree structures.
It assumes that your degree is divided into modules which are comprised of coursework and exams.

The program allows you to create modules and then pieces of work within those modules.
The program calculates statistics of your course progress and displays them.
